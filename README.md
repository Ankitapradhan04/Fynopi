## File Sharing App with Python

This repository contains the source code for a file sharing application developed using Python. The application allows users to:

* **Register and Login:** Users can create accounts and log in to access the file sharing features.
* **Upload Files:** Authorized users can upload files to the server for sharing with others.
* **Download Files:** Users can download files uploaded by other users.
* (Optional) **File Management:** This feature could allow users to view, manage, and potentially share folders within the application.

**Features:**

* User authentication (registration and login)
* File upload and download functionality
* Secure file storage (implementation details depend on your chosen storage method)

**Technologies:**

* Python (version to be specified)
* Importing necessary modules:
  1. http.server and socketserver: To host in the browser.
  2. pyqrcode: To generate QRcode.
  3. png: To convert the QRCode into a png file.
  4. OS: To interact with the Operating system.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/file-sharing-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies (replace `requirements.txt` with your actual file name if different):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the application (create a `.env` file with your configuration details)

**Running the application:**

1. Start the development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the application in your web browser:

* By default, the development server typically runs on `http://localhost:5000/` (the port may vary).

**Development:**

* Feel free to fork this repository and make your own contributions.
* Explore adding additional features, such as file management, user profiles, or access controls.

**Note:**

* This is a basic template to get you started. You will need to implement the specific functionalities like user authentication, file storage, and data transfer according to your chosen libraries and frameworks.
* Security is crucial for file sharing applications. Ensure proper validation, sanitization, and secure storage mechanisms for user data and uploaded files.
